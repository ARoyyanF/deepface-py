# [Notebook](https://github.com/ARoyyanF/deepface-py/blob/main/archive/2025-07-24/experimental_pipeline.ipynb) Explanation:

The notebook outlines a one-to-many face recognition system using the DeepFace library. Here are the core concepts and methods that make this pipeline work:

## One-to-Many Matching:

Unlike one-to-one verification, which compares two specific images, this system matches a single query image against a database containing multiple images for each person. This approach improves accuracy by allowing the system to verify an identity even if the query image differs from a single stored photo due to changes in lighting, angle, or expression.

## Database Management:

The system organizes and manages a structured database where each person can have multiple reference images. This is crucial for the one-to-many matching logic, as it provides a gallery of known faces for comparison.

## Similarity Scoring:

The pipeline calculates confidence scores to determine the likelihood of a match. This is based on the distance between face embeddingsâ€”a lower distance signifies a higher similarity and, therefore, a higher confidence score.

# Pipeline Overview

The authentication test is the culmination of several preparatory steps:

## Setup and Configuration:

The pipeline begins by importing the necessary libraries and configuring DeepFace. This involves selecting a face recognition model, a detector backend, and a distance metric. For this pipeline, the following were chosen:

- Model: Facenet512 for its high accuracy.

- Detector: mtcnn for its reliability in detecting faces.

- Distance Metric: cosine similarity, which is recommended for most face recognition tasks.

- Threshold: A strictness level of 0.4 was set. A lower threshold makes matching more stringent.

## Database Creation:

A structured database is created to store multiple reference images for each person. The FaceAuthenticator class manages this database, allowing for individuals to be added with a list of their images. This one-to-many structure is key to improving authentication accuracy.

## Authentication Function:

The authenticate function implements the one-to-many matching logic. When a query image is provided, it is compared against all reference images in the database. The system calculates the similarity score for each comparison and identifies the best match based on the lowest distance.

## Testing and Validation:

The "Step 2: Test Authentication" section executes this pipeline with sample data. It loads test queries and runs them against the pre-populated database to validate the system's performance and accuracy.
