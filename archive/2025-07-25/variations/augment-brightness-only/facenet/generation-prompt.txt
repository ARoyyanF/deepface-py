in this ipynb, create a one to many face recognition authentication, using ghostfacenet implementation from deepface library, use facenet as fallback if ghostfacenet fails. use json as the database. make the main model & fallback model alongside its face alignment algorithms easily changable.
pipeline:
1. scan for user folders, person1, person2, etc. one person may have multiple images.
2. align the images
3. augment the aligned images by variating lighting angles.
4. create the augmented image embeddings alongside the original. store the vectors to the json file
5. read from a folder containing random faces, compare the embeddings, list top 5 best matches alongside the distance
6. summarize the results to another json file, make sure to log everything needed for further evaluation.
